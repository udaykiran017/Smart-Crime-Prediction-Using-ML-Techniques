# Smart-Crime-Prediction-Using-ML-Techniques
This project utilizes machine learning to analyze and classify crime data. Techniques like KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and SVM are applied to predict crime-related outcomes. The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, and models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with visual insights provided.
